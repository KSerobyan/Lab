This is my first commitment of a project both in Github and in Picsart Academy'sâ„¢  Lab.

The goal of the project was to write a program that would take a text file and compress the content of the file,
if the user chose so.
On the other hand if the user provides a compressed file, the program can take the file and decompress it.

I am happy with what the project turned out to be, but It will be twice as happy to hear any advice or, maybe, criticism regarding my work.
